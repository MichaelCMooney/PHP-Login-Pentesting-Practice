# PHP Login
A generic PHP-based login structure that can be be used to test ethical hacking.

This structure is currently designed to work with MySQL. The name of the user table and the schema are hard-coded in the Registration file, so adjusting those is required if you deploy this with different names.

TriVault and/or any contributors (employed by TriVault) are not responsible for any misuse, abuse, and/or damages caused by the solution provided. TriVault is not liable for any improper configurations that lead to vulnerabilities, attacks, hacks, scans, or issues in any variety.

This login structure can be used for legitimate authentication into web apps, however, it is not currently in its most secure format as it was designed to test ethical hacking procedures. Necessary adjustments are required for a proper and secure deployment.
